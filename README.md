# Requirements

## Overview
We would like you to create a simple Android application that makes network calls to a [joke API](https://v2.jokeapi.dev) and displays them in a list. Additionally, the app should be able to view the joke on a detail screen.

The main goal is to make sure the app can fetch from the api and display them in a list and detail view. So it would be best to focus on functionality of the app the most and then proper theming second. So when you are ready, create a new Android project in Android Studio and dive in!

Note: All features relating to being able save favorited jokes locally are bonus features that you can do if you have the time or are eager to dive into them.

## Design
Before you get started, please check out the [design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/fbb507ff-d752-456d-8cb2-a61ac1b923a8-aee6/) to get a sense for the app's look and feel, get assets, colors, and styles.

Note: To download assets such as the joke category icons use the `</>` button on the right toolbar when on the `Styles` page. This can also be used on other screens so you can inspect things like spacings, fonts, etc. 

## API Note
Make sure to use the `safe-mode` parameter when using the API to make sure things are SFW. See the [section on safe mode](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/#safe-mode) for more details.
